Consumer expenditure on e-commerce sites


Here I am learning and building a model with linear regression and predicting how much a consumer spends on an e-commerce website per year in Dollars
I have used libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation
The first step, I performed an exploratory Data analysis with Time spent on Website and the yearly Amount Spent then using Seaborn I plotted a scatterplot as follows
I first did data visualisation for 2 variables with the yearly amount spent in y-axis and Membership length on x-axis
using the alpha parameter, I can distinguish the density of the data in a region and added a linear model plot.
Then I split the data into training set and testing set, with 70% training set and 30%testing set. having set the test_size of 0.3 i.e. 30% of data
Later used sci-kit learn library to implement Linear regression model. 
Then using the test data and the prediction data i could get an output as follows.
